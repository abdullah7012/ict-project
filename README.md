# ict-project
webiste of a personal store.
The purpose of this ICT project was to design and develop a personal e-commerce website for a fictional
brand called Abdullah Khan Store. This project allowed me to apply HTML and CSS skills practically. The
final website consists of multiple sections such as Home, Products, About, Contact, and a Navigation Bar
with internal links. We also created product listings, integrated image previews, added 'Add to Cart' buttons,
and used modern UI techniques for a visually appealing design.
